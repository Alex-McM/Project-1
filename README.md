# Project-1
Work in a group to complete a project, stipulations being use 2x API's, one must be an external API that hasn't been used in class prior. As a group create a functioning webpage that fulfils a task. The css formatting was to be done in a third-party 


# Chosen task
The group decided on being a restaurant and running a landing page that would display a carousel, reviews and a booking form. The booking form will interact with a weather api to check the weather conditions for the selected booking day. The second api was used to create a menu.

# User story
```
GIVEN I am a customer
WHEN I fill the booking form and submit
THEN ensure all fields are filled correctly
WHEN fields are correctly filled and submitted, give a notification of confirmation
WHEN I click to view menu
THEN show the menu to me

# Problems
- Original intention was to build a site around a booking API, but it was difficult to find a free one or an API that would store data for us to draw from to have "booking information".
- Lack of knowledge of how github worked as a whole until half-way through contributed to doubling up of work and tasks.
- Conflicting availability and work scheduling lead to a lot of missed opportunity for collaboration and updates on progress of certain pieces of the project
- doing most of the project in reverse, lesson to be learned from for future projects.

# Future iterations
- Looking to complete with a more robust booking system that stores data.
- Including pages for further information and an interactive navigation API (directions to reach us)
